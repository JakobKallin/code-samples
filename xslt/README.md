This XSLT script transforms a quiz from an ad-hoc XML format to an HTML-based
representation, which could then be made interactive by adding JavaScript and
CSS. It demonstrates the use of many core XSLT features, including templates,
`for-each` loops, conditionals, sorting, variables, parameters, and XPath
functions.

To run this example, serve the directory from a web server (needed due to
browser security restrictions) and open `index.xml` in a browser, or input
`index.xml` (possibly together with `index.xsl`) into an XSLT processor of your
choice. The output will be a plain HTML document with no CSS or JavaScript.
